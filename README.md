# Bass Defense

You are an innovative musician who has gotten bored of the repetitive tunes made by your contemporaries.  You decide that now is time to change the way music will be played forever. By becoming a patron of new composers, you are able to begin your search for new instruments and styles of music. But watch out, there are those who are resistant to change and will stop at nothing to silence your new sound ! You must utilize your musical knowledge to create a base of operations and defend yourself against the musical philistines throughout the ages. Will you be able to survive? Will your music stand the test of time?
